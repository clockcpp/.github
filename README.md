I'm locked at the home by the *COVID-19* in Shanghai, China.  
This is my work during that(about 2 months) because I'm too vacancy  
  
Be careful because these code *may* contain following content:  
- violent 'algorithm'
- a little annotation
- stupid class structures
- silly spelling mistakes
- and so on..
  
Look, I'm __not__ counting on that you are able to understand and improve it like other projects(e.g. new pull requests, discussions), I only need a few new issues then I am able to make it better.  
  
I'm just uploading these things as a project for distributing the code to some people that need it, and also I understand that you may don't want to see this,__if you are like that__, just click "back" button in your browser and then exit this project.This will make both of us feel better.  
  
If you read this, that means you understand everything above.  
Anyway, thank you and have fun.  
  
Well, here comes the code...
