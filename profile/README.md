## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

🙋‍♀️ __ClockCPP__: a lot of functions that supports you do anything you want to the classic windows console, without learning many WINAPI !  
🌈If you have any idea, you can contact us with Discussion, Issues or PRs!  
💻You may find more detailed instructions in different repos

I'm locked at the home by the *COVID-19* in Shanghai, China.  
This is my work during that(about 2 months) because I'm too vacancy  
  
You may ask y I'm not gonna write a plugin that automatically buy food for me.  
Because I'm already write one :/  
  
Be careful because these code *may* contain following content:  
- violent 'algorithm'
- a little annotation
- stupid class structures
- silly spelling mistakes
- and so on..
  
Look, I'm __not__ counting on that you are able to understand and improve it like other projects(e.g. new pull requests, discussions), I only need a few new issues then I am able to make it better.  
  
I'm just uploading these things as a project for distributing the code to some people that need it, and also I understand that you may don't want to see this,__if you are like that__, just click "back" button in your browser and then exit this project.This will make both of us feel better.  
  
If you read this, that means you understand everything above.  
Anyway, thank you and have fun.  
  
Well, here comes the code...
